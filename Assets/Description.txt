Gas Mileage calculates your vehicle's fuel economy. Tracking your fuel usage helps you keep an eye on the health of your vehicle and see how changes to how you drive affects your mileage. Gas mileage is a simple application that does one thing and does it well.

Other mileage tracking applications require you to add entries every time you fill up and if you forget, it is difficult to catch up. Gas Mileage is different, just remember to reset your odometer every time you fill up your tank and then add entries when you remember.

To start using the application,

1 - Fill-up your car and reset your odometer. Do not enter a reading.

2 - Next time you fill-up your car, enter the amount of fuel you added and the distance you have driven, then reset your odometer.

3 - To enter a fill-up in the application, select your vehicle from the dropdown and press to add button in the upper right.

If you ever forget to reset your odometer when you fill up, just do it next time.

If you have multiple vehicles, manage them using the menu and select the current vehicle in the dropdown.
